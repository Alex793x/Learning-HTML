<!-- 
    Whenever we want to present sports events, or stocks, reports or train timetables
    a grid system the best opportunity we have. We often leverage that presentation
    through a table option. Table options oftenly represents rows and columns a bit like a spreadsheet.

    <!-- 
        Tables is a representation of information through a grid format.
        It allows us to to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.

        Each block in the grid is refered to as a "table cell". In HTML we write these 
        tables out row by row.
        The common basic table is initiated through the table element tag: <table> </table>
        Then we add "table rows": <tr> </tr>
        And each table row should include "table data", which is writen with: <td> </td>
     -->

     <table>
        <tr>
            <td>100</td>
            <td>200</td>
            <td>300</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>400</td>
            <td>500</td>
            <td>600</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>700</td>
            <td>800</td>
            <td>900</td>
        </tr>
     </table>

     <br />

     <p>
        Notice how we have 3 rows, with data inside. Aswell as three columns with each 3 rows.
     </p>

     <!-- 
        Unfortuntately a basic table lacks some heading information, since we hae no idea what each row or column means.
        This is achieved with table headers, which is by default presented with a bold texture. 
        the build is very similair, but we use "table head" element tag: <th> </th>
        Then like before we add different table rows and fill out the data. 
        
        We finallize the table header element tag with a scope="", indicating if it's representing a column or a row. 
      -->

      <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th scope="col">Monday</th>
            <th scope="col">Tuesday</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Meters run</th>
            <td>2000</td>
            <td>4000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Meters swimmed</th>
            <td>1000</td>
            <td>3200</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

     <p>
        Notice the headings in a bold texture. Once again we are having 3 columns with 3 rows. <br />
        The first row has an empty th, since we want it to look neat and correct through out the days.
     </p>

     <!-- 
        Sometimes tables should span over more than a single column, and one way to achieve this is by using 
        the inbuilt feature called colspan="" which allows us to inside the quotation marks set the amount of 
        columns a given table data cell should span over. This is highly useable whenever we want to present 
        specific actions given over days or maybe hours, if our table head would represent different days or hours. 

        The principle dosn't change of how we setup the tables, but like the scope, we can define a another attribute
        named colspan after the inside opening element tag: <td colspan=""> </td>
      -->

      <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th scope="col">9am</th>
            <th scope="col">10am</th>
            <th scope="col">11am</th>
            <th scope="col">12am</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Wednesday</th>
            <td colspan="2">Geography</td>
            <td>Math</td>
            <td>Programming</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Thursday</th>
            <td colspan="3">Programming</td>
            <td colspan="">Software System</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Notice how different classes are spanning over multiple hours. <br />
        While software System dosn't start before the last hour. 
     </p>

     <hr /><br />

     <!-- 
        So surprisingly enough you can also span over rows.
        So just like spanning through multiple colums where hours would be defined at top,
        we could also simply span over rows. This gives us a huge workfield of opportunities. 

        We define this by using the inbuilt attribute rowspan="" which is very similair to colspan="".
      -->

      <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th scope="col">ABC</th>
            <th scope="col">BBC</th>
            <th scope="col">CNN</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">6pm-7pm</th>
            <td rowspan="2">Movie</td>
            <td>Comedy</td>
            <td>News</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">7pm - 8pm</th>
            <td>Sport</td>
            <td>Current Affairs</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        It might be difficult to see, but the Movie section is spanning over two rows, <br />
        and by default when we go to the next row and enter a new table data, since the Movie <br />
        element is already defined to take up two rows, code block automaticly puts the Sport <br />
        element at the second position.

     <!-- 
        The last table option is called long tables.
        Just like the HTML is build up with a header, body and footer - The Long Table setup shares exactly same structure.

        We define a table as we normally would: <table> </table>
        Then we add in a "theader": <thead> </thead>
        inside of the thead we add our rows, columns and data. 

        Then we add a "tbody" section: <tbody> </tbody>
        This section will be filled out with the context of the actual data, this is normal structure again with rows, columns and table data.

        At the end we insert a "tfoot" section which rounds up the Long table section: <tfoot> </tfoot>
        just like normally we will indulge with rows, columns and table cell data. 

        the following example should make sense after you read this.
      -->

      <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">Date</th>
                <th scope="col">Income</th>
                <th scope="col">Expenditure</th>
            </tr>

      <p>
        This shows the effectiveness of a Long table. Since we here very easy <br />
        can design a somewhat usefull spreadsheet, indicating whats top, body and footer.
