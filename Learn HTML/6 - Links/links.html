<!-- 
    It is a very common thing to link content to different content. 
    Most websites are made up of other links to other websites, or adds, banner adds, 
    youtube videos or email links. 

    It is a very normal thing to link certain things to your website... think about Wikipedia
    Whenever we enter Wikipedia millions of references in the form of links would be placed.

        We use the ancor tag <a href="  YOUR LINK HERE IN BETWEEN   "> </a>:
        We call this ancoring... because we ancor a link to a specific point, 
        meaning that inbetween the opening / closing tag, we specify a word, to represent the link. 
        For instance we could specify an IMDB Link.

     <h1 id="top">Lord of the Rings</h1>
     <a href="#prologue">Prologue</a>

     <p>
        My favorite move from the trilogy - Lord of the Rings is the Two Towers. 
        check out their <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/"> IMDB</a> score.

     <!-- 
        Beside linking to other websites, we could also link to a different part of our website. 
        Since most pages on our future website would be made up of many different HTMLs files.
        Whenever these files are in the same directory, we can ancor each section with references through the ancor tag. 
        This way a user can click on different part of our website and actually go there.

        This way of organizing and pathwaying to different aspects and places of your website is called 
        relative URLS. It is a shorhand way of telling the "browser" that any relative urls we pin within the ancor
        is either a child or parent file within the same directory.

      <!-- 
        Sometimes we want to open another tab or new window for a website ... We use the same principle
        but simply redirect the target to a blank (new window) page.
        We use the same ancor tag with a target attribute - <a href="" target="_blank">
       -->

       <p>
        Let's head over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
        and see what they have to say about the Lord of the Rings, Two Towers.

        The last thing to look at regarding linking, is the self linking option of content. 
        Since a blogger can have a very huge content with many different sections, it would be a great tool for the blogger
        to make links for readers to click and be directed directly to the section they find interesting. 

        This is achieved by Id's. Both within an ancor tag, but also directly within the element tag: <h1 id=""> <h1>
        if you scroll up you would see our header h1 has an unique id called top!
        You will also see the prologue ancor with strangely hashtag followed with the word prologue. 

        In HTML hashtags indicates an id, and as you can see further down, we placed the id to our prolouge header. 
        This means that when we click on the ancor title top called prologue, the page automaticly direct us down to the section. 
       -->

       <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
       <p>
        The Lord of the Rings is composed of six "books", aside from an introduction, a prologue and six appendices. <br>
        However, the novel was originally published as three separate volumes, due to post-World War II paper shortages and size and <br>
         price considerations.[2] The Two Towers covers Books Three and Four.
       </p>

      <!-- 
        If we click the top ancor in the bottom, the page will take us back to the top! 
        This way the link possibilities also enables us a content designers to engage our audience to an interactive experience
        rather than a scrolling experience.
