    <h1>The plot of The Two Towers</h1>
    <hr /> <br />

    <p>
        The Fellowship is torn apart. Sauron's power is growing stronger. While venturing on to Mordor, <br> 
        Frodo and Sam come across the grotesque creature Gollum, who is forever consumed by the Ring's power. <br> 
        Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli meet up with new allies in the Plains of Rohan. Together, <br>
        they must work to defend the people of Rohan against Sauron's puppet Saruman as he unleashes his armies from Isengard. <br>
        All the while, Sauron prepares to launch an attack on Gondor. The War for the Ring begins here.
