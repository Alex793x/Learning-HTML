    <!-- 
    Whenever someone intends to indicate an important section of content on our HTML, we always 
    use the strong opening/closing tag - <strong> </strong> by default browsers will show this 
    content with bold expressions.
    -->

    <strong><p>
        I am a very important line!
    </p></strong>


    <!-- 
      Describing something with "emphasis", or "subtley" changes is best known with the 
      emphasis opening/closing tag <em> </em>. 
      This result in the words getting italic, if they are wrapped with the emphasis tags.

     <p>
      The middle <em>WORD</em> is italic.

     <!-- 
      Quotations on an website can be handled through two different ways. The blockquote tag <blockquote> </blockquote>, 
      or the q opening / closing tags <q> </q>.
      The blockquote is used for LONGER quotes which takes up an entire paragraph, thus wrapping around the paragraph element <p> </p>. 
      Browsers tend to indent the content by default, you should rather achieve this effect using CSS. 

      The q is used for shorter quotes, which sits within a paragraph sections. 
      Unfortunately Internet Exlporer dosn't achieve to understand the <q> which makes most people avoid even using the tag.

      <!-- 
         Abbreviations - shortened form of a written word, a good practice would to always wrap such word with the abbreviation tag. 
         The following thing, should also be applied for acronyms. Rather than explaining in details the following example shows 
         both usecases in action.
