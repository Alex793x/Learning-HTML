        This can be achieved with the insert / deletion or strike tags. 

        Insert: <ins> </ins>
        Deletion: <del> </del>
        Strikenotation: <s> </s>

        The insert would be indicated with an underscore, while deletion would mark out with a strike the words. 
        In the form of HTML, the s tag indicates something which shouldn't be deleted, but simply rather as "isn't" relevant anymore. 
     -->

     <p>
        In this phrased <del>fuck</del> beautful words <ins>MUST</ins> should be aimed and prefered to use. 
     </p>

     <p>
        The sentence above is <s>not relevant</s> very relevant!
