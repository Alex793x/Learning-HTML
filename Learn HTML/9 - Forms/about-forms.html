<!-- 
    Forms is a very crucial implementation towards any HTML sites.
    Especially when someone expects activity or certain behavior within their website.

    If we want to find out a focus groups perception of our platform through answers
    we would need them to click and fill out forms. 
    Something as simple as storing a users password, username, email and address etc.
    requires forms to be filled out. This section will go through all the forms to which
    we can implement on our website.

    <!-- 
        Before we address the topic forms we need to address "Form Controls"
        The principle of Form control is to understand the different ways forms can be filled.

        We categorize 4 form types: Adding Text, Making Choices, Submitting Forms and Uploading Files.

        Adding Text: 
         - Text input: Used for single line of text such as emails, addresses and names.
         - Password Input: Like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.
         - Text area (multi-line): For longer areas of text, such as messages and comments.

        Making Choices:
         - Radio Buttons: For use when a user must select one of number of options.
         - Checkboxes: When a user can select and unselect one of more options. 
         - Drop-down boxes: When a user must pick one of a number of options from a list. 

        Submitting Forms:
         - Submit Buttons: To submit data from your form to another web page.
         - Image Buttons: Similair to submit buttons but they allow you to use an image.
         
        Uploading Files:
         - File Upload: Allows users to to upload files (e.g. images) to websites.
     -->

     <!-- 
        The next topic is the processing of the forms, I'll keep it short and simple.

         - A user fills in a form and presses a button to submit the information to the server.
         - The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user entered or selected
         - The server processes the information through e.g. Java or store the data on a database.
         - The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

         And thats how a form is being handled overal
      -->

      <!-- 
        Following example will show the form structure - 
        We first initiate the form element tag, with attributes being action, method and later on id:
        <form action="" method=""> </form> between the opening and closing tag we'll add commonly some type of 
        paragraph with information about whats happening.
       -->

       <h1>Example of positioning a Form</h1>
       <br />
       <form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
        <p>
            This is where the form controls apear.
        </p>
       </form>
       <hr /> <br />

       <!-- 
        TEXT INPUT:
        Sometimes we want a a user to input a text, in form of password, text or other situations.
        We use the input element tag which has different usable attributes being type, name, size and max length: 
        <input type="" name="" size="" maxlength="" /> 
        
        The type attribute is indicating whether the text should be viewable or not. If we put in password as parameter
        the input from user would be redefined in bullets / circles hiding the userinput. 

        The name attribue indicates where the data is being stored, in our case we want to store a "username". 
        Lastly the maxlength ensures a user only can use maximum values to enter within the form.
        -->

       <h1>An example of input form</h1>
       <br />
       <form action="http://example.com/login.php">
        <p>
            Username: <input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Password: <input type="password" name="password" maxlength="30">
        </p>
       </form>
       <hr /> <br />

       <!-- 
        TEXTBOX:
        Now lets imagine we posted an image, and we allow visitors to leave comments.
        To have this form, we would need a textbox to which visitors can enter something and submit. 
        we use the "textarea" form: <textarea name="" cols="" rows="">
        
        The cols and rows indicates how long or high the comment box should be.
        Under normal circumstances you would want to use CSS to control the width and height of such textarea element.

            <figcaption>What do you guys think about this picture?</figcaption>
            <form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php" >
                <textarea name="comments" cols="106" rows="4">Enter your comments....</textarea>
            </form>
        </figure>
        <hr /> <br />

        <!-- 
            RADIO BUTTONS:
            Another way of enganging and receiving submits of user interactions is through "radio buttons".
            Normally this is a single option where user choose among different options.
            We define the radio buttons with the element tag: <input type="radio" name="" value="" />

            Take note that name describes for instance the genre or category, while the value defines the actual value
            which the servers sends back again.

            We can also add a checked="" attribute, which prechooses one of many options.
         -->

         <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
            <p>
                Please select your favorite Lord of the Rings character. 
            <br />
            <input type="radio" name="characters" value="Aragorn" /> Aragorn
            <input type="radio" name="characters" value="Legolas" /> Legolas
            <input type="radio" name="characters" value="Gimli" /> Gimli
            <input type="radio" name="characters" value="Gandalf" /> Gandalf
            </p>
         </form>
         <br /> <hr /> <br />

         <!-- 
            CHECKBOX:
            A different approach which allows users to deselect or select multiple options is using checkboxes.
            compared to radio buttons the check box is an empty square, when clicked adds a checkmark.

            The composition is very similair to radio buttons, but we put a different parameter for the type="checkbox"
          -->

          <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
            <p>
                Please select your favorite movie service(s):
            <br />
            <input type="checkbox" name="service" value="HBO" /> HBO
            <input type="checkbox" name="service" value="NETFLIX" /> NETFLIX
            <input type="checkbox" name="service" value="DISCOVERY" /> DISCOVERY
            <input type="checkbox" name="service" value="DISNEY+" /> DISNEY+
            </p>
          </form>

          <br /> <hr /> <br />


          <!-- 
            DROP DOWN LIST BOX:
            Another tool at the HTML authors hand would be the Drop Down List Box.
            As the name indicates a drop down list to which a user can choose an option from will be presented.
            For a change the select element tag will be used instead of input element tag: 
            This is ofcourse wrapped inside of a form element tag. 

            The syntax is as follows: <form> <select> <option> </option> </select> </form>

            So the select element tag is a drop down box, while the option element tag, is used to 
            specify the options to which a user can choose from inside of the drop down box. 
           -->

           <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
            <p>
                Which country are you born in?
            <br />
            <select name="countries">
                <option value="Denmark">Denmark</option>
                <option value="Poland">Poland</option>
                <option value="Hungary">Hungary</option>
                <option value="Sweeden">Sweden</option>

            </p>

           <br /> <hr /> <br />

           <!-- 
            MULTIPLE SELECT BOX:
            The drop down list box, is useful for single choices, but can also be upgraded for multiple choices.
            The setup is very similair but differentiates since the drop box is a fixed box showing multiple options a user can choose. 
            
            It is comon curtesy to inform how a visitor or user can actually choose extra options. 
            We will use the multiple attribute inside the select element tag: <select name="" size="" multiple=""> </select> 
            to allow users choosing multiple options. The size option is for presenting options available.
            -->

            <form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
                <p>

                    multiple options can be chosen.

            <!-- 
                FILE INPUT BOX:
                We are back at the input element tag, but for this instance we want the visitor/user to upload a file. 
                Maybe we want to verify his credentials in the form of Drivers License. Maybe it's for his profile picture.
                The reasons could be many.
                To allow file uploads we fill in the type="" attribute with the parameter file. 
                This will automaticly make the inbuilt feature create an uploading instance for us. 
                We also need to use the method attribute with post as being the parameter: method="post"

             <form action="http://www.example.com/upload.php" method="post">
                <p>

                SUBMIT BUTTON:
                Could be known for subscribe button, submit it button ... anything relatet to a user submitting something.
                We already used the same submit feature with our File input box. 
                The difference with the Submit button is that we mix it with text input and submit input.

                Even though a standard subscribe button seems fine, many web developers likes flair and personality. 
                We can customize our buttons based on a image preference, maybe you want a logo to be clicked, or other creative ideas.
                The composition is identical, only change is the parameter of the type. Instead of submit we use image.
