        Since I'm only intending to use the <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> basics 
        to showcase this simple page, I would deffinetly call this website being <strong>very</strong> simple!

    <p>
        With the power of <sup>10000</sup> i can achieve <del>upperplaced</del> numbers shown with <ins>superscript</ins>. <br> 
        I could also write a lot of chemical formulas with the subscript <del>taaaaaaag</del>. H<sub>2222222222222222</sub>O - Now check that out! <br>
        Also take note how the we are <s>deleting, and striking of few of the words</s>

    <p>
        If you look very <em>carefully</em>, we managed to use most of all the most structural basic-notations of the HTML language. <br>
        <b>Be proud if you understand what I mean!</b>
