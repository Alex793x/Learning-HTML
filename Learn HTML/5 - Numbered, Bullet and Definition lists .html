<!-- 
    It is very common to show lists on many websites. 
    Sometimes in the form of bullets, numbered or defintions. Different approaches can be achieved
    by using tags for appropiate purposes. We can even achieve nested lists within a HTML script.

    <!-- 
        The first list which I will covere is the ordered list. 
        The tag for indicating that this is ordered looks like this: <ol> </ol>. 

        The next thing to remember is that any list item should be wrapped with the list tag: <li> </li>. 
        This way everytime a new list opening / closing tag occurs, a new number will be defined for it. 
     -->

     <ol>
        <li>This is the first item on my list: Eggs</li>
        <li>This is the second item on my list: Milk</li>
        <li>Guess what, this is the third item on my list: Honney</li>
     </ol>

     <br /> <hr /> <br />

     <!-- 
        The second list form is known as the unordered list. This can also be remembered as the bullet list. 
        The way we wrap this list is by using the unordered tag: <ul> </ul>.

        The next thing is like with the ordered list, to wrap the list items or content with the list tags: <li> </li>.
        This time, there won't be a number, but the list will instead be showed with black circles.
      -->

      <ul>
        <li>This is the first item on my list: Ketchup</li>
        <li>This is the second item on my list: Mayonaise</li>
        <li>This is the third item on my list: Remolade</li>
      </ul>

      <br /> <hr /> <br />

      <!-- 
        The last type is called the Definition list, which is based on the title format. 
        A given title / definition of the list is shows content of what we intend to show. we use the definition list tag: <dl> </dl>.

        This time we will indicate a tittle / definition with the definition title tag: <dt> </dt>
        This will wrap the title of the definition we want to write. 

        Lastly we use the definition term tag: <dd> </dd> which holds the definition content inside of it! 
       -->

       <dl>
        <dt>Dogs</dt>
        <dd>Dogs are a beautiful creature, and known to be mans best friend!</dd>
        <dt>Cats</dt>
        <dd>Cats are known to be the most selfish animal, not caring for anyone else, than themself. <br />
            It is also known that cats have up to 9 lifes .... that's some craaazy shit!</dd>
        <dt>Lions</dt>
        <dd>The king of all animals, with a biting force stronger that anyother cat animals.</dd>
       </dl>

       <!-- 
        The last way to make lists, is "nested" lists. These lists will have unfilled circles showing that the list 
        item belongs to a nested list. 
        We often use these within a bullet list. 

        The syntax dosn't change, only that we nest a unordered list within a list tag: <li> <ul> </ul> </li> 
        Inside of the unordered list tag, we put new list tags. The comming example will show this. 
        -->

        <ul>
            <li>Breakfast:
                <ul>
                    <li>Egg and Bacon</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella with oil and tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Scrample Eggs with honey and MÃ¼sli</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lunch:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tuna Sandwhich</li>
                    <li>Mexicana burger</li>
                    <li>Mushroom Salad</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dinner:
                <ul>
                    <li>Steak with Wine Sauce</li>
                    <li>Hamburger</li>
