<!-- 
    Images are a fundemental core to any website designs, which is also why when it comes
    to manipulation and edditing, a lot of attributes can be added and changed with images.
    For instance we can manipulate the height, width, scale and opacity to make any image we
    wish to have on our website present the right fit of our intentions.

    <!-- 
        Whenever we want to add an image we take up the img element tag which has a self-closing-tag: <img src="" alt="" title="" />
        We add the source destination, which often is a directory within the folder storing all the images.
        Then we fill out the alt section with a overal description of the image, if the browser would be unable to load the image.
        Lastly we fill out the title which makes the description written in the title come forward if the mouse is hovering over the image.

        We can further add manipulation in the form of height and weight to our image this is done with the attributes width="" and height="".
        
        If we wanted to point the image from a website, we could directly inside the src="" add the websitelink of the image try replace with the following link:

     <h1>My Favorite Scenes from Lord of the Rings</h1>
     <hr /> <br />

     <img src="./images/Aragorn Scene.jpg" alt="Scene from the Lord of the Rings" width="1200" height="800"
        title="The moment where Aragorn receives the pedal of light from his elven lover" />

     <p>
        This is a great scene and totally my favorite scene due to the beautiful presentation of the movie plot between Aragorn and Ewyn.

        <!-- 
            It is very important to do nottice, that there is a huge matter in regards of positioning the image in the HTML code. 
            We can also choose the presentation of the image based on the placement of the img element tag. 

            Notice the above image, having the paragrah right underneath it. 
            We could also set an image inside of a paragraph resulting in a very different presentation. The following example will show this situation.
         -->

     <p>
        <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/academy-award-nominee-fran-walsh-philippa-boyens-peter-jackson-for-picture-id80417015?s=2048x2048" 
            alt="Scene of Gandalf and Frodo" width="800" height="600" title="Gandalf is in deep thoughts of worries about what to do with ring, which Frodo holds" /> 
            Notice how this paragraph sits very differently on the image, it is directly comming after the image has been shown.
     </p>

     <!-- 
        Another way to have images is placing the img element tag in the middle of a paragraph.
        This won't be a common way of doing it, but understanding the placement and watching the actino gives a great opportunity when it comes to understanding 
        how HTML works. 

        Notice how we a using the direct link of the images in the src="". 
      -->

      <p>
        This example will show a picture of a Gandalf drawing, but the image will be right in the middle 
        <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/gandalf-the-wizard-in-the-artwork-from-the-film-the-lord-of-the-rings-picture-id169412645?s=2048x2048" 
            alt="Drawing of Gandalf with a very large sword" title="Gandalf in the mist of a cloud pointing with his large sword" width="600" height="800" />
        This really shows how weird a placement of images can be!
