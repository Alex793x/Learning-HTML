<!-- 
    So whenever someone is talking about Headings and paragraphs
    One would be talking about <h> </h>  which is a heading openening/closing tag.
    There are 6 sizes, ranging from h1 -> h6 indicating h1 as being the largest font size. 

    While <p> </p> would be a paragraph opening/closing tag. 
    Each of these (<h> / <p>) indiciates what we normally would understand in the software
    Office - Word as being title or text. Whenever you want to make a title your would choose 
    a header size. While any substance, in the form of text .. is written as being paragraphical.

    <!-- In HTML we have 6 different heading sizes which will be given an example of further down -->
    <h1> This is the largets heading size </h1>
    <h2> This is also a heading, but the size is lesser </h2> 
    <h3> This is another smaller heading </h3>
    <h4> So is this.... </h4>
    <h5> Aaaaand this...</h5>
    <h6> This is the smallest heading option to choose among</h6>


    <!-- The next section is a paragraph  -->
    <p>
        This is a paragraph ... its nothing else than ordinary text which 
        we provide to our website
    </p>



    <!-- 
        When it comes to font-weight (being bold texture or italic texture) two options are available
    <b> </b> which is bold texture. 
    <i> </i> is being italic texture. 
    
    The way to manipulate any text is to wrap the texture inside of the <b> or <i> tags 
    -->

    <b><p>
        This is a bold texture, since the paragraph tag is wrapped with the bold openeing /closing tag.
    </p></b>

    <i><p>
        This is italic texture, since the paragraph tag is wrapped with the italic openening/closing tag.
    </p></i>



    <!-- 
        When manipulating text with mathematical expressions, we often want to define numbers upperplaced or downplaced. 
        This is called to the power of x or footnotes with chemical formulas. In other words Superscript / Subscript.
    
        To make words/letters/numbers indicating to the power of or upperplaced we use the <sup> </sup> opening/closing tags.
        To make words/letters/numbers indicating chemical or footnoting expressions we use the <sub> </sub> opening/closing tags.

    <p>
        This line has many following numbers in a superscript expressions: <sup>12345678910</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        This line has many letters in a subsript expression: <sub>abcdefghijklmnopqrxyzæøå</sub>
    </p>



    <!-- 
        Sometimes we want to add manually a "line break", in other words a new line. The most common way 
        whenever we do that in HTML is with a break expression: <br /> Whenever this tag is placed after a word/letter/number
        a natural new line will be added.

        Beside new lines, we often uses horizontal lines or more correctly called horizontal "rules". 
        Such rule is a line splitting text or content with an horizontal line and is written as <hr />. 
    -->

    <p>
        This paragraph has a newline <br />
        Look how the text is suddenly spanding over two lines, while also having a few new lines untill the next paragraph. <br /> <br />
    </p>

    <p>
        This pargraph is top.
        <hr />
        This paragraph is bottom... can you see the horizontal line above this paragraph?
